ORM - Object relational Mapping
Allows writing python classes that can be then mapped to be used with target language (for django it is database)

Django uses Django template language which is similar to Jinja template language to give the developer flexibility of manipulating server response on client side, resulting in better User experience.
Django Rest Framework (DRF) is used to build API using Django. DRF offers pre-build middlewares for fast and better development which is ready to use for productions and large scale projects. It also offer developers to integrate other APIs for example.  with GCP / Azure / AWS active directories which allows your application to have SSO authentication.
